The main objective is to build a runtime analyzer tool that compares various sorting algorithms and their performance. This will help in determining which sorting algorithm is the most suitable when performing tasks with a heavy workload. The metric used in comparing the algorithms is the elapsed time after execution. The sorting algorithms tested include:
•	Quicksort
•	Merge sort
•	Bubble sort
•	Selection sort
•	Built-in sorted function in Python
The program first loads a file containing the sorting algorithms. It then prompts the user to input the size of list they want to create(random list), the maximum value in the list and how many times they want to run the algorithms.
The output shows the various algorithms and the time they each took to finish sorting the random list generated for the number of runs the user specified.
